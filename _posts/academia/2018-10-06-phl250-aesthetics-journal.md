## Week 1; What is aesthetics?
In fact, what is a world *without* aesthetics?

Undeniably, such a world - that is, a world without aesthetic qualities - would be:
> [...] inferior, if not uninhabitable altogether. Consequently, a person without capacity for an aesthetic response, if even possible, would not quality as a fully developed human being. — **(Gardner, 2003.)**

This statement by Gardner presents itself as particularly striking to me. As a young adult living in our current generation of youth, art—and by extension, aesthetics—is most often dismissed as mere tripe, or something that's not to be taken seriously, in favour of fields of interest that are directly tied to the era of technological advancement that we live in.

What then, does Gardner's quote imply about a sizeable chunk of my generation?

That's not to say that I, myself, harbour the same disinclination towards the Information Age—quite the opposite, in fact, as I've grown up fostering an insatiable curiosity for all things digital and mechanical.

However, I would always be perplexed at how some people just couldn't view art with the same fascination that others did. What was it about art that caused people to have wildly varying (inconsistent, even) reactions?

I've long since concluded that individuals with indifferent attitudes towards art are, a) unable to understand the depth behind the creative arts, or b) simply unwilling to explore the process behind such matters—which may occur for a whole wealth of reasons, none of which should be vilified in the slightest.

With that being said, perhaps I, myself, never properly understood the subtleties of art itself. After being introduced to the first week of this subject and becoming a tad bit familiarised with the 'philosophy of art', it's clear that there was still much for me to learn.
