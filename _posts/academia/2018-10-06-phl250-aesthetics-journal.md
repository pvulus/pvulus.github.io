## Week 1: What is Aesthetics?
In fact, what is a world **_without_** aesthetics?

Undeniably, such a world—that is, a world without aesthetic qualities—would be:
> [...] inferior, if not uninhabitable altogether. Consequently, a person without capacity for an aesthetic response, if even possible, would not quality as a fully developed human being. — **(Gardner, 2003.)**

This statement by Gardner presents itself as particularly striking to me. As a young adult living in our current generation of youth, art—and by extension, aesthetics—is most often dismissed as mere tripe, or something that's not to be taken seriously, in favour of fields of interest that are directly tied to the era of technological advancement that we live in.

What then, does Gardner's quote imply about a sizeable chunk of my generation?

That's not to say that I, myself, harbour the same disinclination towards the Information Age—quite the opposite, in fact, as I've grown up fostering an insatiable curiosity for all things digital and mechanical.

However, I would always be perplexed at how some people just couldn't view art with the same fascination that others did. What was it about art that caused people to have wildly varying (inconsistent, even) reactions?

I've long since concluded that individuals with indifferent attitudes towards art are, a) unable to understand the depth behind the creative arts, or b) simply unwilling to explore the process behind such matters—which may occur for a whole wealth of reasons, none of which should be vilified in the slightest.

With that being said, perhaps I, myself, never properly understood the subtleties of art itself. After being introduced to the first week of this subject and becoming a tad bit familiarised with the 'philosophy of art', it's clear that there's still much for me to learn.

## Week 2: Art as Representation.
I think it can be universally agreed upon that art, in all its different shapes and forms, seems to be *about* something—to **represent** something. The key question then, as brought up in the Eldridge (2003) reading this week, is *how* representation is achieved in these various forms of media.

The following questions, taken from the Eldridge (2003) reading, come to mind when attempting to reason with the above:

  * Does representation involve any likeness or resemblance between the representer and the represented?
  * Is the same sense of "representation" involved in different mediums?
  * **Does the value of a work depend upon what it represents; and if so, how?**
  * Is representation **even necessary** for art? Is it sufficient?

Take for example this 6-minute excerpt of **Kashiwa Daisuke's**
*Stella* (which I highly recommend [listening to in full](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7cdynwRMA)), played over the backdrop of-for lack of better words-a hauntingly ambiguous 'art' film.

While I'm sure this video seems to signify nothing in particular to a lot of people, many of them would be hard-pressed *not* to call it 'art'. However, if art ought to be defined as representation, then can we really say this video is art? What exactly r
