## So, let's talk.
Hi, I'm **Veronica** and welcome to Jackass.

...Or more accurately, welcome to the online space where I try to be *at least* semi-coherent in a desperate attempt to express myself as a person.

I've been thinking of creating a personal blog to curate the random thoughts I encounter in my day-to-day life for quite a while now; perhaps a little over two years, in fact.

Why has it taken me this long, you ask? (You may not actually be asking, but I'm going to answer it anyway.)
  1. I am the shittiest procrastinator you will **ever** meet. Seriously.
  2. See above.

Truth be told, attributing everything to my non-existent productivity is a gross oversimplification of things—but we'd be here forever if I were to list everything else. I suppose [in the end, it doesn't really matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVTXPUF4Oz4); I'm here now, aren't I? (Sorry. You knew that link was coming.)

## Okay, but why?
For a whole lot of reasons, actually; aside from giving myself an outlet for my thoughts, this blog also serves as a practical learning experience that I hope to retain and put to use. Given my notoriously shit track record, who knows how long I'd keep it up for? But I'll try my best, I promise.

### The blog itself
As you can most likely tell (or can't, that's totally fine too), this site was created with the magic combination that is [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I've always enjoyed fiddling around with customisation as a hobby, proving time and time again how **utterly hopeless** I am at coding anything substantial. Through random bouts of tinkering around, my goal is to be sufficiently educated in Jekyll; or at the very least, enough so that I could proficiently construct my own site without the help of someone else's template.

### I'm becoming illiterate
My God, where do I even start? Ever since I could remember, I had invested my heart and soul into the world of literature. Back when I was in the sixth grade, the first thing I did when I arrived home was to flop onto the couch and proceed to read a book for the next three hours—*every single day, without fail*. I ignored **everyone**; teachers in my class (yikes, sorry), kids in the playground, the general public, you name it—simply because I would, more often than not, be too absorbed in a book to take notice of anything else. It all sounds rather trivial at the mention of "the sixth grade", I know; but it was all I knew for the first seventeen years of my life.

I don't remember when I stopped reading and writing. It's a thought that saddens me every time I come across it—and I now realise it's because literature was always something I needed to feel like I was going anywhere at all. That's a blog post for another time, though.

In short, this blog also serves as an excuse for me to write **something**—anything, really. Anything to keep my literacy skills from deteriorating any further than it already has, and anything to rekindle the passion I once had.

### I need to cancel my expiry date
Part of the reason why I tiptoed around the idea of a blog for so long is because I cared too much about what other people would think of me; I didn't want to voice my thoughts and opinions on matters that may seem downright silly or insignificant to other people. This applies to many other decisions I've made in my lifetime so far, and I have come to realise that it is, in part, holding me back from growing as a person. This blog exists so that I can stop being a wet blanket, and finally step out of a comfort zone that I have been stagnating in for far too long.

## Are you done yet?
This post turned out way lengthier than I expected, so the answer is yes; for now, at least.

So, until then.
